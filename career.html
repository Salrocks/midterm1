<div class = "intro"

	<p1> Growing up in a third world country leaves no room for you to be decent. In essence, I had to do what’s require of me to be great one day so I can help my parents. Since I already like heights and going very fast on the roads one couldn’t ignore the fact of become an airline pilot. The benefit of making money and traveling the world is top tier. Becoming a pilot will be my ultimate accomplishment in life because it is a very hard career to land especially with large airlines like Delta, American and United. Being a pilot for me is a chance to see the world from above, something some of us will never be able to experience. It makes you realize how small we are compared to this humongous planet, which I should say is one of the smallest in our solar system. Hopefully someday I’ll be able to say, “ welcome aboard this is captain Sal.”  </p1> </div> <br> <br>
