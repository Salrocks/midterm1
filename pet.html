	<p1> When covid hit, life got miserable on my mind. Being locked in the home, always on the phone and can’t be active outside would always take a toll on my mental. That’s when I came up with the brilliant idea of adopting a pet. Cats are so soft and adorable that it left me no option but to get one. First time I met Oreos he was very quiet and shy. We spent a few minutes bonding and playing and ever since then, he has been the anchor to my life. This was the best emotional decision I’ve ever made in my life. As a side note he is 1 year old and his favorite treats are temptations.  </p1>  </div>
